<p>If you've never ever heard of VoIP, get ready to alter the way you think about long-distance call. A cloud-based phone system transfers calls through data networks instead of through conventional phone lines.

<p>Some MLTS systems (also referred to as PBX, or by other names), which typically require dialing 9 to acquire a dial-tone for an outside line may not be able to reach calls to short code" numbers such as 2-1-1, 7-1-1, 8-1-1 and 9-1-1.
