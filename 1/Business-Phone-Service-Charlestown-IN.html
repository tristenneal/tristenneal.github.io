<p>But cloud phone systems do away with the PBX metaphor and rather settle for a various concept: Unified Communications (UC). Some features, such as voicemail to text, are special to cloud-based phone systems. A micro-sized office could get by quickly with the bare-bones Office Pro setup, but the sophisticated functions of Office Pro Plus and Office Enterprise are appealing for a couple of dollars more: the Nextiva mobile voice and video app and the Team Existence status sign (both included in Office Pro Plus) are useful upgrades, as are call recording and the number-meshing Nextiva Anyplace app (Office Enterprise).</p>
