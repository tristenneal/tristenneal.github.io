<p>A kind of business VoIP services where the VoIP equipment, services and servers are hosted by the VoIP provider, which handles calls and routes them to and from the subscriber's existing telephone system and equipment. Depending upon the type of PBX system, it will have different hardware set up. It can consist of the telephone systems, cable televisions, and the switchboard itself, which is often housed in a cabinet; alternatively, other types of PBX systems operate on computer system servers, that make them more compact.
